## Gearbox protocol

This repository contains the code for middleware between Gearbox V2 and third-party protocols.

### What is Gearbox protocol?

Gearbox is a generalized leverage protocol: it allows you to take leverage in one place and then use it across various
DeFi protocols and platforms in a composable way. The protocol has two sides to it: passive liquidity providers who earn higher APY
by providing liquidity; active traders, farmers, or even other protocols who can borrow those assets to trade or farm with x4+ leverage.

Gearbox protocol is a Marketmake ETHGlobal hackathon finalist.
